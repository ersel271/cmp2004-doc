# 1. Introduction and Purpose (Architecture and Implementation Plan)

This document defines the software architecture and development plan for an Android mobile educational application to be developed during the Spring 2025 semester as part of the CMP2004 - Advanced Java Programming course. The document is structured according to the [arc42](https://arc42.org/) software architecture template.

It serves not only as a structural architecture document but also as a **development plan** that outlines which module will be developed in which file/class and how it will be organized.

The project aims to deliver educational content in a fun and interactive way for children aged 7â€“10. It features both learning and game modes to help children understand and reinforce the concepts.

The project will be developed in Java for the Android platform. It will manage user and score data using Firebase Authentication and Firestore and offer a user-friendly interface designed following Material Design principles.

## 1.2 Scope of the Document

This document is structured to achieve the following goals:
- Define the fundamental architectural structure of the application
- Plan how educational modules will be integrated into the system
- Specify the file and class structures that will guide development
- Design all components in an organized manner from the UI layer to data access

Thus, this document serves both as a **design reference** and a **project development guide** for developers.

# 2. Architectural Overview

This project will be developed as an Android-based mobile application providing educational content for children. Through learning and game modes, it aims to deliver interactive content on various topics (such as reading clocks, seasons, directions, memory games, multiplication tables, etc.).

The application's architecture adopts a **modular and function-based structure** to ensure simplicity, sustainability, and scalability. The project uses Androidâ€™s classic `Activity`-based structure, where each educational module is defined in a separate `Activity` class. Data handling and user interactions are managed directly through these `Activity` classes.

### 2.1 Structural Layers

- **Activity Layer:**  
  These are the screens where the user interacts directly with the application. Each game or learning module has its own dedicated `Activity`.

- **Helper/Manager Classes:**  
  These are classes that handle common functionalities, such as voice feedback, character animations, and score calculations.

- **Firebase Layer:**  
  This layer handles user authentication via Firebase Authentication and data storage via Firestore.

### 2.2 High-Level Architecture Diagram

Below is a high-level architecture diagram that shows the components of the application and the fundamental relationships between them:

```

### 2.3 Planning Notes

- Each `Activity` is developed as a single class containing both its visual and logical components.
- Modules include both "learning" and "game" oriented screens, and these are typically implemented as separate `Activity` files.
- Shared components (e.g., the talking character, voice responses, score calculations) are managed through centralized files such as `TalkingCharacter.java`, `LearningPartActivity.java`, and `PlayingPartActivity.java`.
- Data management is handled directly using the Firebase SDK; no additional `Repository` or `ViewModel` layer is used.
- 

# 3. Scope and Context (Context Boundary)

This mobile application is an educational tool designed to run on the Android operating system and can function both online and offline. While user interactions take place directly on the device, user identity management and data storage are synchronized with Firebase infrastructure when an internet connection is available.

The system primarily includes the following components:

### 3.1 System Scope

| Component                    | Description |
|-----------------------------|-------------|
| Android Mobile Application  | The main environment where the project operates. Users interact directly with this application. |
| Firebase Authentication     | Handles user registration and login processes. |
| Firebase Firestore          | Stores scores, game data, and user-specific progress information. |
| On-Device Resources         | All media content such as animations and images are stored locally on the device. |
| Text-to-Speech (Optional)   | Androidâ€™s native TTS service may be integrated in the future for narrated explanations. |

```

### 3.3 Out of Scope

The following elements are not directly part of the system but are indirectly related:

- **Parent Panel / Parent Account**: Currently out of scope based on project requirements; may be implemented in the future.
- **Social Media Sharing**: There is no feature to export or share user scores.
- **Multiplayer Games**: The project is limited to individual user interaction only.

# 5. Solution Strategy

This section summarizes the core design decisions, technologies to be used, and overall solution strategies for the system. The chosen approaches aim to ensure a user experience tailored to the target audience â€” children aged 7 to 10.

## 5.1 Platform and Language

- The target platform is the **Android** mobile operating system.
- The application will be developed using the **Java** programming language.
- Android SDK tools will be used in combination with the **Android Studio** IDE.

## 5.2 Architectural Approach

- The application follows a traditional **Activity-based architecture**.
- Each learning module is defined as an independent `Activity` class and manages its own functionality directly.
- UI components will be designed to be child-friendly, adhering to **Material Design** principles.

## 5.3 Data Management and Synchronization

- User registration and login processes will be handled via **Firebase Authentication**.
- Data such as scores, game progress, and user profiles will be stored on **Firebase Firestore**.
- Data access and synchronization will be achieved directly through the Firebase SDK.

## 5.4 Media and Interaction

- **Animations, icons, audio files, and characters** will be stored locally on the device.
- All user interfaces will be designed with simplicity and child-friendliness in mind.
- For voice narration, Androidâ€™s built-in **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** engine may be optionally integrated.

## 5.5 Extensibility and Maintainability

- All learning modules will follow a common development template based on the `LearningActivity` and `PlayingActivity` concept.
- Shared components (mascot character, scoring, feedback sounds) will be implemented as **abstract base classes** or placed in reusable `utils` or `managers` packages.
- The design will allow for easy future extensions such as adding new modules, switching languages, or visualizing data.

## 5.6 Testing Strategy

- **Instrumentation tests** will be used at the application level to verify activity behaviors.
- Firebase synchronization and user scenarios will be primarily validated through manual testing.
- Basic **unit test** classes will be implemented by the developer to verify correctness.

# 6. Building Block View

This section describes the components of the application, their responsibilities, and their structural relationships in a layered format. Each component consists of sub-units that serve different functions.

## 6.1 Top-Level Components

The application consists of the following high-level components:

- **Activity Layer:**  
  Contains both user interfaces and business logic. Each learning or game module has its own dedicated `Activity` class.

- **Helper Classes:**  
  Independent classes used for shared functionality like character animation, voice narration, and game control mechanisms (e.g., `TalkingCharacter`, `LearningPartActivity`).

- **Firebase Layer:**  
  `Firebase Authentication` handles user session operations, and `Firestore` is used for storing scores and user data.

- **Assets / Resources:**  
  Media content such as images, audio files, and animations are located in this layer.

- The application can work offline; however, an internet connection is needed for login and data synchronization.
- The Text-to-Speech feature will be available only on supported devices.

---

# 8. Cross-cutting Concepts

This section discusses common concerns that affect the entire system, such as recurring patterns across modules, general design principles, UI consistency, language support, security, and accessibility.

## 8.1 Multi-language Support

- The application will support **two languages**: **Turkish and English**.
- All text content will be defined in `strings.xml` resource files.
- Users can easily change their language preference from the settings menu.
- Text-to-Speech (TTS) support may be provided in both languages for voice narration.

## 8.2 Consistent UI Design

- All `Activity` screens will follow **Material Design** principles with a simple and child-friendly interface.
- The main character (mascot) and similar UI elements will be consistently reused across all modules.
- Colors, button placements, and feedback mechanisms will be standardized throughout the app.

## 8.3 Audio and Visual Feedback

- In cases of success, error, or interaction, both **audio** (positive feedback sound) and **visual** (animations, icons, color transitions) feedback will be provided.
- Especially in learning screens, children will be encouraged to recognize correct answers through visual cues.

## 8.4 User Experience (UX)

- The user will be able to reach any module from the main screen in **no more than 3 taps**.
- The interface is designed to be clean and distraction-free, considering special learning needs such as dyslexia.
- Texts will be large, readable, and displayed in a child-appropriate font.

### 8.5 Shared Code Reuse

- Classes like `TalkingCharacter`, `LearningPartActivity`, and `PlayingPartActivity` are used to **avoid code duplication** between modules.
- Functions such as feedback animations, TTS calls, and score calculations will be managed from a single point (e.g., `utils`, `manager` classes).
- The infrastructure is designed to allow easy reuse by any new learning or game module.

Below is a structural diagram showing how these shared components are reused across various modules:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    classDef android fill:#d0f0c0,stroke:#27ae60,color:#000;

    subgraph Shared Components
        Character[TalkingCharacter]:::android
        LearnBase[LearningPartActivity]:::android
        PlayBase[PlayingPartActivity]:::android
    end

    Clock[ClockActivity]:::android --> Character
    Clock --> LearnBase
    Clock --> PlayBase

    Seasons[SeasonsActivity]:::android --> Character
    Seasons --> LearnBase
    Seasons --> PlayBase

    Directions[DirectionsActivity]:::android --> Character
    Directions --> LearnBase
    Directions --> PlayBase
```

## 8.6 Offline Access

- The application is designed to work offline.
- Once the user is logged in, games, images, sounds, and animations can be accessed from the device's internal storage.
- Firebase is used only for synchronization and persistent data storage.
